        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Shortened in length, the term Burger is used to describe a popular sandwich made from ground meats that are formed into a patty, <br>
             cooked, and placed between two halves of a bun. Although the most common Burger is made with meat, there are many alternatives<br>
              that do not include meat, such as tofu or ground vegetables. </p>
